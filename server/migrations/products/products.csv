This amazing plant was domesticated thousands of years ago near Lake Titicaca, high on the plateaus of the Andes, and it was a mainstay in the diet of the ancient Incas. Quinoa is delicious on its own and in pilafs, soups and salads.

Our Gluten Free Thick Rolled Oats are made from oats grown by our cooperative of over 200 farmers dedicated to growing only pure, high-grade oats. Each farm delivery is sampled hundreds of times and tested with an R5 ELISA gluten test to ensure the absence of gluten. Advanced color-sorting removes undetected impurities. Finally, the oats are packaged in our 100% gluten free facility and tested for gluten again to ensure their purity. Thick Rolled Oats (and we mean nice and extra thick!) are uniquely Kiln Toasted. These extra chewy oats produce extremely satisfying robust European-style cereal and yeast breads. Oats as we know them today originate from the wild red oat, a plant with origins in Asia. Originally cultivated for medicinal purposes, they were used as animal feed for a long time before humans deemed them fit for consumption. Oats helped fuel the civil wars in Scotland and have deep roots in Great Britain, Germany and Scandinavia. Today oats are widely accepted as nutritional powerhouses for dietary fiber and protein. Oats contain a special type of fiber that is especially good for the reduction of cholesterol called beta-glucan. Beta-glucans also aid in the support of the immune system and can help regulate blood sugar. They are also wonderful for soothing irritated skin when used in baths. Ask the person next to you to name all the ways we can eat oats, and as oatmeal porridge, for breakfast - would be the likely answer, followed quickly by oatmeal cookies, granola, and granola bars. But that's only the beginning. There are many ways you can cook with oats. They make a great crispy coating; they extend meatloaf and burgers, while enhancing their juiciness; or they can make a savory side dish.

Our Gluten Free Quick Cooking Rolled Oats are rolled extra thin to shorten the cooking time. They are made from oats grown by our cooperative of over 200 farmers dedicated to growing only pure, high-grade oats. Each farm delivery is sampled hundreds of times and tested with an R5 ELISA gluten test to ensure the absence of gluten. Advanced color-sorting removes undetected impurities. Roasting enhances that wholesome robust flavor you expect. Finally, the oats are packaged in our 100% gluten free facility and tested for gluten again to ensure their purity. The modern oat draws its ancestry from the wild red oat, a plant originating in Asia. Oats have been cultivated for two thousand years in various regions throughout the world. Before being consumed as a food, oats were used for medicinal purposes, a use for which they are still honored. The growing of oats in Europe was widespread, and oats constituted an important commercial crop since they were a dietary staple for the people of many countries including Scotland, Great Britain, Germany and the Scandinavian countries. In the early 17th century, Scottish settlers brought oats to North America. Today, the largest commercial producers of oats include the Russian Federation, the United States, Germany, Poland and Finland. Scores of studies have documented the many health benefits of oats. Eating oats helps lower LDL bad cholesterol and may help reduce the risk of heart disease. Oats help you feel fuller longer, which helps control your weight. Oatmeal and oats may help lower blood pressure. Oats may help reduce your risk of type 2 diabetes, since their soluble fiber helps control blood sugar. Oats are high in beta-glucans, a kind of starch that stimulates the immune system. Oats are higher in protein and healthy fats, and lower in carbohydrates than most other whole grains. They contain more soluble fiber than any other grain. Oats contain more than 20 unique polyphenols called avenanthramides, which have strong anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-itching activity. They also have the best amino acid balance of all the cereal grains. Gluten Free Quick Cooking Oats make a delicious and healthy instant oatmeal alternative to the little packets other brands offer (those being loaded with preservatives and sugar). Get yourself a container, measure out enough quick oats for the week and add in extras like chia seeds, flaxseed meal, dried fruit, nuts, seeds - whatever dry ingredients you love in your oatmeal! When you're ready for breakfast, scoop out a servings worth, add in some steaming hot water and let sit for about 5 minutes or zap it for 20 seconds in the microwave and you've got a healthy and easy breakfast ready to go.</p>","PHYSICAL","","","true","https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5ab127302487fd2c665fa5bb/5ae9d5286d2a73ce723cdaf5/5ab5619bb2a84d6315b656c3/1521837223582/B66448.jpg","BWC66448","Title","Default Title","","","","","44.00 USD","0.00 USD","","0.019841604","0.0","0.0","0.0","Unlimited"

At that point we had yet to discover the spurtle - a centuries-old Scottish wooden porridge stirring implement.

Our team's belief in our porridge skills and our consistently superior oats never wavered. That crisp October morning all teams paraded through town behind a bagpipe band. After three heats of competition, we remained one of five finalists. All five finalists prepared their traditional recipe - oats, salt and water - for the judges. Finally, the announcement: Bob's Red Mill, is the new Golden Spurtle World Porridge Champion. The Bob's Red Mill Steel Cut Oats we knew to be superior were now proven the WORLD's BEST .

A coarse meal was produced by slowly grinding the kernel between two large mill stones. Many years ago, Bob visited Scotland and learned the art of stone milling at the historic, water-powered Preston Mill. Today, Bob's Red Mill Organic Scottish Oatmeal is produced in the same old fashioned way and contains all the health giving nutrients of the best quality oats from which it was ground--the germ, the oil and the fiber. The result is a surprisingly unique and flavorful hot cereal. Today oats are widely accepted as nutritional powerhouses for dietary fiber and protein. Oats contain a special type of fiber that is especially good for the reduction of cholesterol called beta-glucan. Beta-glucans also aid in the support of the immune system and can help regulate blood sugar. They are also wonderful for soothing irritated skin when used in baths. Scottish Oatmeal is the original porridge of ancient Scotland and has been a staple breakfast here at the mill for years. This whole grain oatmeal makes a deliciously, smooth and creamy hot cereal to start your morning off right and add fiber to your diet.</p>","PHYSICAL","","","true","https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5ab127302487fd2c665fa5bb/5ae89b95aa4a992684ebe63d/5ab561a0b2a84d6315b6589b/1521837259970/B09221.jpg","BWA09221","Title","Default Title","","","","","82.00 USD","0.00 USD","","0.05732019","0.0","0.0","0.0","Unlimited"
